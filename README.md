# GNNs-with-MLOps
Various GNN algorithms such as GAT and GCN are trained on datasets to detect the pre-determined patterns. Overall, running an end-to-end procedure with assistance of complete MLOps for node-classification tasks.
## GCN on Diamond patterns 
This network is capable of achieving a training accuracy higher than 90%. 
Possible Future work: Close the gap between training and validation (overfitting) with Cross-validation and other regularization methods.
